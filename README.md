Description:

  The IoT pet feeder project aims to automate the feeding process for pets using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. It typically consists of a feeding mechanism 
  controlled remotely via a mobile application or web interface. Users can schedule feeding times, portion sizes, and even monitor feeding activity remotely. 
  Additionally, some versions may include features such as webcam integration for visual confirmation of feeding, notifications to alert owners of feeding events, 
  and even automatic reordering of pet food when supplies run low. Overall, the project enhances convenience for pet owners and ensures their pets are fed on 
  time, even when they're away from home.
